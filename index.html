      <h1>A day in the life of a sanitation worker during COVID-19</h1>

      <p>What is it like to be a sanitation worker during a global health crisis? The staff at New York City News spent some time with a few of the unsung heroes from the DSNY Bronx 12 Sanitation Garage in the Baychester section of the borough.</p

    <p>This is the garage where sanitation workers meet each morning prior to being deployed on their routes that cover the jurisdictions of 10466, 10467, 10469 and 10475.</p <div class=" container">

    <p>When we think of the term "essential workers" more often than not, sanitation workers are kept off this list. Since the beginning of the pandemic, sanitation workers in the "Big Apple" have become a part of the frontline
      workforce that keeps the city running. However, as we approach the autumnal equinox, a second wave of the novel coronavirus is expected to hit. But this time much worse, due to COVID-19 combining forces with the flu.</p <div class=" container">

    <p> "You can go your whole life without ever calling a firefighter or a police officer, but you can't go more than a couple of days without having a sanitation worker in your life," said Belinda Mager, the Communications Director of the New York
      Department of Sanitation. "They visit your block at least a couple of days a week and you may not even know it! But you'd know if they weren't there!”

    <p> Sanitation workers provide services that ensure the comfort and cleanliness of the general public. However, there were some astonishing numbers disclosed by DSNY personnel suggesting that by the end of June, of the approximately 10,000
      sanitation workers employed by the DSNY across the five municipalities, 628 of them have tested positive for COVID-19. Of the 628 infected, seven have died. Queens sanitation worker Raymond Copeland was the city’s first casualty resulting from
      coronavirus-related complications.

    <p> "With the pandemic happening, I feel a responsibility to come and help the rest of the city," said Diego Dallas a 10-year vet of the department. "We are lifeguards, we are essential workers and we have to be here to help everyone else."

    <p> According to multiple sources at the garage, based on keeping a tracker, they confirmed that litter and other waste products in residential areas has increased by 40%. Sanitation workers in the five boroughs are acclimating to unusually high
      levels of waste, as COVID-19 keeps many of the non-essential workers at home.

      <p> "There's way more cardboard," he stressed to the staff of New York City News. "There are a lot of boxes from Amazon, FreshDirect too, a lot of Instacart and oh how can I forget, FedEx."
